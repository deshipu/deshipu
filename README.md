An open source Python programmer by day, a robot building supervillain by night. I dabble in many things, depending on what catches my insterest, most recently it has been CircuitPython and user-programmable handheld game consoles, previously walking robots, wikis, roguelike games, remote-controlled single-rotor helicopters, wargame miniature painting, tinwhistle and ocarina, typography and industrial design, usability, drawing and animation, pixel art, and so on.
